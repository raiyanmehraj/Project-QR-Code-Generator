# Project-QR-Code-Generator 
## resources used to make this project-https://youtu.be/g1j9rR-H1lk?feature=shared
This project is about creating a Web based QR code generator using HTML,CSS and JavaScript. It is using a text or URL as an input to build a URL for the QR code API to generate a QR code for the given input. Basically the entire project can be divided into 3 parts- HTML(the skeleton of the webpage),CSS(to make the webpage more beautiful with design and animations) and JavaScript(for creating functionality).
On the HTML section,I've created a container where I've used input tag where the input will be written down , a button to submit the input and an 'imgBox' identifier where the whole box would expand to show the qr code after pressing the button with a input. If the button is pressed without any input the 'imgBox' would not expand and stay hidden.
Then on the CSS section , I've added some designs to different parts of the website, especially to the 'imgBox' when the button is clicked with or without any input.When input is given, the 'imgBox' would expand , otherwise it would not and without input the whole thing would be considered as an eror and it would shake the input field if it's empty.I've added animations to make it more attention grabbing.
In the JavaScript section, I created the variables 'imgBox', 'qrImage', and 'qrText', and used them within a function that controls the behavior based on whether the user provides input or not.When the input is provided this fuction will use the QR code API to generate a QR code and shows it in the 'imgBox' . I've implemented this fuction to take action whenever the button is clicked.
